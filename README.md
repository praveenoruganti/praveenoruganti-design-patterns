# Praveen Oruganti Design Patterns

## Why Design Patterns?
1. Design patterns are used for solving recursive problems in a software application design.
2. A design pattern is a description for how to solve a recursive problem.
3. Design patterns are not a technology or a tool or a language or a platform or a framework.
4. Design patterns are effective proven solutions for recursive problems.

## How many Design Patterns?
SUN Microsystems constituted a group with four professional with the name of Gang of Four (GOF) to find effective solutions for the recursive problems.
According to GOF, they found 23 design patterns as effective solutions for re-occurring problems.
Java design patterns are divided into 3 i.e. Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

### Creational patterns
Creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case. Ex. Singleton pattern – used to restrict the creation of an object to one instance.

Here with the Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory Pattern - subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
2. Abstract Factory Pattern - A Factory of Factories
3. Singleton Pattern
4. Prototype Pattern
5. Builder Pattern.
6. Object Pool Pattern.

### Structural patterns
Eases the design by identifying a way to realize relationship between entities.
Ex. Flyweight pattern – high quantity objects to share common properties object to save space.

Here with the Structural Design Patterns.
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Filter
4. Composite
5. Decorator
6. Facade
7. Flyweight
8. Proxy

### Behavioral patterns
A solution for the ideal interaction between objects and how to provide loose coupling and flexibility
Ex. Observer pattern – get notified of the change of the state of an object being observed (observer/subject)

Here with the behavioral patterns
1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Momento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template method
11. Visitor
